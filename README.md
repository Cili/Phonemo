# Phonemo *by Jon Cili, Ashley Kim, & Anna Wyndham*

## Mission Statement
For the Advancement of Phonemic Awareness
## Overview
The creation of words and their integration into common English vernacular is a convoluted process that results in a society with an outdated and immutable vocabulary. Phonema is a word creation app where users can utilize the 44 English phonemes to develop unique English words. In addition to allowing users to formulate and store phonemic strings and grapheme representations of the strings, the app will allow users to contextually define and share their words with others via a social media interface.
